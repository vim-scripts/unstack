*unstack.txt* Extract/Open lines from stack traces

==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                                           *unstack*

Feed all or part of a stacktrace into this plugin and it will open a new tab
with each level of the stacktrace in a new vsplit. This can be useful for
seeing more context around an exception or to quickly edit offending files.

Unstack also supports opening lines from the quickfix list.

==============================================================================
LIMITATIONS                                                *unstack-limitations*

1. Only Python and Ruby stacktraces are recognized, but this can be extended 
   via the |unstack_extractors| setting.
2. If a stack trace contains relative paths, they must be relative to Vim's
   current working directory.

==============================================================================
OPTIONS                                                        *unstack-options*

|unstack_mapkey|      shortcut to launch unstack default <leader>s
|unstack_showsigns|   whether or not to show signs on stacktrace lines
|unstack_extractors|  regexes for finding files/lines

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                *unstack_mapkey*
Values: string
Default: <leader>s

Press this combination with a visual selection (or in normal mode followed by
a motion) to edit 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             *unstack_showsigns*
Values: 0 or 1
Default: 1

If this is set to 1, unstack will put a |sign| on lines in the stacktrace.
These signs will be visible in any window in the current vim session showing
that file.

                                                            *unstack_extractors*
Format: [extractor1, extractor2... ]

This is the list of |unstack-extractors| that will be evaluated in order to
extract a stack trace from the selected block of text. Setting this list wipes
out any default extractors. If you want to keep the defaults but add an
extractor to the list:
* get the defaults by calling unstack#extractors#GetDefaults()
* add your extractors to the defaults
* set g:unstack_extractors to the combined list

==============================================================================
EXTRACTORS                                                  *unstack-extractors*

Extractors are dicts with an extract method that takes in text and returns a 
stack trace in the form [[filea, linea], [fileb, lineb]... ] by writing your
own extractors, you can extend Unstack to handle parse stack traces with new
formats!

If your extractor does not find any files, it should return an empty list
If you can't extract line numbers, just use 0 for all line numbers

To make an extractor, do something like this:

let my_extractor = {}
function my_extractor.extract(text) dict
  "convert text to a "stack" or return empty list if text format invalid
endfunction


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REGEX EXTRACTORS             *unstack#extractors#regex* *unstack-regex-extractors*

If you want to write an extractor for a format where file path and line number
can be extracted with regular expressions, there's a built-in factory to help
you.

For instance, in python, stack traces look like this:

  File "foo.py", line 10, in my_function
    divide(1, 0)
  File "math.py", line 6, in divide
    return  a / b

First we want to form a regex that only matches valid lines with files:
        '\v^ *File "([^"]+)", line ([0-9]+).+'

Replacing this with the thing in the first perens (\1) yields the file path.
you can test this by putting your cursor on the first line of the stack trace
and running:
        :s/'\v^ *File "([^"]+)", line ([0-9]+).+'/\1/

running this should yield foo.py

repeating the process with \2 should yield the line number (10)

We now have all the necessary pieces. We can make our extractor by calling:

unstack#extractors#Regex('\v^ *File "([^"]+)", line ([0-9]+).+', '\1', '\2'),
